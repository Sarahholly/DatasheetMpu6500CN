The MPU-6500 is a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP) all in a small 3x3x0.9mm package. It also features a 512-byte FIFO that can lower the traffic on the serial bus interface, and reduce power consumption by allowing the system processor to burst read sensor data and then go into a low-power mode. With its dedicated I2C sensor bus, the MPU-6500 directly accepts inputs from external I2C devices. MPU-6500, with its 6-axis integration, on-chip DMP, and run-time calibration firmware, enables manufacturers to eliminate the costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing optimal motion performance for consumers. MPU-6500 is also designed to interface with multiple non-inertial digital sensors, such as pressure sensors, on its auxiliary I2C port.

The gyroscope has a programmable full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000 degrees/sec and very low rate noise at 0.01 dps/√Hz. The accelerometer has a user-programmable accelerometer full-scale range
of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, and ±16g. Factory-calibrated initial sensitivity of both sensors reduces production-line calibration requirements.
